Examples
------------------------------

These are full applications that demonstrate how to use the sodym library.
For a complete guide on how to use different parts of the library, refer to the HOWTOs.

The examples are available as Jupyter notebooks in the `examples` folder of the sodym repository.
You can modify and run them interactively in a Jupyter notebook environment.

All examples were created by Stefan Pauliuk for ODYM and adapted for sodym here.
